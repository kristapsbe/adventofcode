# Advent of code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023

You can run code for all days via 
```bash
run.sh
```
I'm thinking of trying to use:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - don't have a single working solution yet
- [CLisp](https://clisp.sourceforge.io/) - don't have a single working solution yet
- [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) - haven't tried to do anything with it yet

**Note** - the inputs are user specific
